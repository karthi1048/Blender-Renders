Welcome to the **Blender-Renders** repository! 

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the final rendered images & videos from my various Blender projects.

## What's Inside
Here you'll find good quality renderings in both PNG and JPEG formats, created using Blender's powerful **Eevee** and **Cycles** render engines. Rendered videos are available in MP4 format created using **Eevee**.

Each image represents a different project, while each video would be an animation related to the rendered image highlighting my experimentation with lighting, materials, and abstract design.

## Render Engines
- **Eevee**: Real-time render engine used for fast and efficient rendering with high-quality results.
- **Cycles**: Path-tracing render engine known for realistic lighting and detailed effects.

## Explore the Renders
Browse through the collection to see the diversity of creative styles and techniques I've explored. All images & videos are freely available to view or download.
